> :construction: This project is in early development

Simple and automated installer for your own self-hosted Bitcoin and Lightning node. You can use this project
to install a ready to use Bitcoin Core or Lightning node (or both). Note that Docker is not required since
services are running using Systemd services.

At this moment, you will need to have Ansible installed on your local machine in order to run this project. See the [examples](examples)
folder for more information on how to run this project. The remote machine doesn't need to have any special
requirement, just an SSH server up and running.
