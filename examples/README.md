# Configuration examples

Ansible examples to configure a specific network or any other interesting feature. At this moment, we have the
following examples:

* [Bitcoin and LND sharing the same host](uni-host)
* [Bitcoin and LND in different hosts](multi-host)

### Requirements

In order to run the examples you need to have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed.
