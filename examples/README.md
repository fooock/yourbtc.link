# Configuration examples

Ansible examples to configure a specific network or any other interesting feature. At this moment, we have the
following examples:

* [Run Bitcoin and LND on same host](simple)
* [Run Bitcoin and LND in different hosts](remote)
* [Run Bitcoin and LND on a Raspberry](raspberry)

### Requirements

In order to run the examples you need to have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed. For the
Raspberry installer, you only need Ansible.
